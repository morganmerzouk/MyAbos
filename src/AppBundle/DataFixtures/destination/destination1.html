Our itineraries include the best spots of the island and often some of St Martin’s spots as well (we like to combine both islands, that are very different but close enough to allow us to visit both during a week long cruise).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">There are stunning kitesurfing spots to explore and the island offers tonnes of thrilling downwinders.</span></p>
